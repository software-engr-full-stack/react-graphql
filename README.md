# A simple GraphQL client app

I built this app to learn about GraphQL.

# Usage

1. Clone this repo

2. `cd` into the clone directory

3. `npm install`

4. This project works in conjunction with the [GraphQL server project](https://github.com/software-engr-full-stack/rails-graphql). The default port for this app which is 3000 is used. The following command will start the development server on port 3001:
`PORT=3000 npm start`

5. Open your browser to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
